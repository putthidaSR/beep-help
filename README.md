# beep-help
An Android app that turns everyone's phone into a transmitter that can send SOS signal from the phone's speaker. No cellular signal needed. 
It makes the phone last longer than other technologies while sending SOS signal. Any phone can locate the one that is sending SOS and let it know the help is on the way.
